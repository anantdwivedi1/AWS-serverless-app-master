# SpaceFinder - Serverless Auth Reference App

**SpaceFinder** is a reference mobile app that allows users to book conference rooms, work desks, and other shared resources. The app showcases **serverless authentication and authorization** using the AWS platform.

The mobile front-end is built using the [Ionic 3 framework] and client libraries to call AWS services and mobile backend APIs. The backend APIs themselves are powered by AWS services. The backend APIs are built using a serverless architecture, which makes it easy to deploy updates, and it also means that there are no servers to operationally manage.

SpaceFinder is primarily developed and maintained by Jim Tran and Justin Pirtle, Solutions Architects at Amazon Web Services. The project code is released under the Apache 2.0 license. Please feel free to make use of the code in this project, and spread the word. We hope you enjoy it, and we certainly welcome all feedback, pull requests and other contributions!

## Video presentation

A live demo of the SpaceFinder app was presented at [AWS re:Invent 2017], the annual AWS cloud computing conference. The presentation provides useful context on the authentication and authorization flows that the app demonstrates. The YouTube recording of the session (53 minutes) is available here:

* [AWS re:Invent 2017: Serverless Authentication and Authorization: Identity Management for Serverless Architectures (SRV403)]
<br/>Presenters: Justin Pirtle and Vladimir Budilov
<br/>Presented on: November 28, 2017

## Quickstart and Developer Guide

1. The [Quickstart guide](Quickstart.md) walks through setting up a demo environment (5 minutes) with a tutorial of key app flows (30 minutes). This lab is self-contained and cleans up after itself by un-deploying all auto-generated AWS resources.

2. For developers who want to dig deeper, we've also prepared a [Developer Guide](DevGuide.md). The Developer Guide provides instructions on setting up the project pre-requisites manually in your developer environment.

## AWS services used

SpaceFinder is built using the following AWS services:

* [AWS Cognito] - Amazon Cognito lets you easily add user sign-up and sign-in to your mobile and web apps. With Amazon Cognito, you also have the options to authenticate users through social identity providers such as Facebook, Twitter, or Amazon, with SAML identity solutions, or by using your own identity system. Furthermore, [AWS Cognito] supports [User Groups] that let to create collections of users to manage their permissions or to represent different types of users.   
* [AWS Lambda] - AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration.
* [Amazon DynamoDB] - Amazon DynamoDB is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service for all applications that need consistent, single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. It is a fully managed cloud database and supports both document and key-value store models.
* [Amazon API Gateway] - Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. You can create an API that acts as a “front door” for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end services, such as workloads running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), code running on AWS Lambda, or any Web application. Amazon API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management.
* [AWS CloudFormation] - AWS CloudFormation gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable fashion.

## Backend API

Spacefinder uses a Serverless API built using Amazon API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudFormation. The API has the following REST methods, and some methods can only be called by users with "Admin" privileges.

## Mobile app

The mobile app is a hybrid mobile app, and is built on the [Ionic 3 framework], which relies on [Angular 4] and [TypeScript 2]. The hybrid mobile app can run on Android devices and iOS devices, as well as a modern web browser.

## User flows

The app currently demonstrates the following user flows:

* Identity Management
  * Register as a new user
  * Confirm registration code
  * Sign in (as a user who has already confirmed a registration code)
  * Sign in (as a user who has not yet confirmed a registration code)
  * Re-send registration code
  * Forgot password
  * Change password
  * Sign-out
* SpaceFinder Application Features
  * View list of locations
  * Add a new location (Admin-only feature)
  * Delete a location  (Admin-only feature)
  * View list of resources at a location
  * Add a new resource (Admin-only feature)
  * Delete a resource (Admin-only feature)
  * View resource availability
  * Book a new booking
  * Cancel own booking
  * Cancel another user's booking (Admin-only feature)
  * Upload a profile image to Amazon S3
  * Toggle display of admin-only features

## Using the app

#### Sample users and data

Sample users and location/resource data are created as part of the bootstrapping process, to make it easy for you to try out the user flows. Use the following users to login to the application. You may additionally create your own personal accounts.

* Standard user
  * Username: `user1`
  * Password: `Test123!`
  * Can browse resources, make bookings, and upload profile picture

* Admin user
  * Username: `admin1`
  * Password: `Test123!`
  * Can additionally create and delete locations and resources

#### Console logging

Enable the browser developer console (or remote debugging for Android) to view all of the log messages.

The log messages will show you all tokens retrieved as part of the sign-in process, as well as all API calls made and the corresponding authorization for each call.
