# Serverless Authentication and Authorization Quickstart Lab

This lab demonstrates how to demo the SpaceFinder reference app, and help you understand the interactions between Cognito User Pools, Cognito Federated Identities, API Gateway, Lambda, and IAM.

>**Estimated cost:** The estimated cost to run this lab for an hour is $0 for AWS Accounts eligible for the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), and less than $0.25 for other AWS accounts.

> Please be sure to complete the "CLEANUP" section after you're done with the lab!

# Here's the high-level plan...

1. **SETUP** (5 minutes): Provision an EC2 instance, and run the pre-built SpaceFinder Docker container. Configure your AWS credentials, deploy the AWS resources, and start the Ionic 2 server.
1. **INTERACT AND LEARN** (30 minutes): Interact with the hybrid mobile app, and gain insights with the behind-the-scenes info displayed in the browser's JavaScript console. Explore how the AWS resources are configured.
1. **CLEANUP** (1 minute): Stop the Ionic 2 server, and un-deploy the AWS resources.

# SETUP (5 minutes)

Setup is quick and easy. You'll provision an EC2 instance, and run the pre-built SpaceFinder Docker container. Once your AWS credentials and configured and the AWS resources are deployed, you'll start the Ionic 2 server which will serve up the hybrid mobile app.

1. **Create a highly-privileged IAM user, if necessary.** The lab needs permissions to provision/de-provision Cognito User Pools, DynamoDB tables, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, API Gateway configurations, CloudFormation stacks, and IAM roles. You will need the AWS credentials (AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Access Key ID) associated with this highly-privileged user later on in step #5.
	> All resources are created in your personal AWS account. This lab is self-contained and cleans up after itself by un-deploying all generated AWS resources.
  
1. **Launch the EC2 instance** in your AWS account, using a public community AMI which contains a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/awsdevops/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app/) with a pre-configured SpaceFinder environment:

	- **Public Community AMI**: `ami-d1f865ab` (only available in us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region)
	- **Instance type**: t2.medium
  - **Network**: Select any VPC that has a **public subnet**. (If you haven't modified your "default VPC", that will work fine for this lab.)
  - **Subnet**: Launch in any **public subnet** (in any AZ). 
  - **Auto-assign Public IP**: Enable
  - **Security Groups:** Open up ports 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) to `0.0.0.0/0`
  - **SSH keypair:** Associate it with an SSH keypair of your choice
  - **Name:** You may wish to tag your instance with a name (e.g. "AWS-Auth-Lab") to make it to easier to identify later, and to remind yourself to delete the instance once you're done with the lab.
  - For all other EC2 launch settings, you can use the defaults.
1. **SSH into the EC2 instance**. The AMI is based on Amazon Linux, and the username to SSH into the instance is `ec2-user`. ([Instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html))

		ssh -i /path/to/keypair.pem ec2-user@PUBLIC_DNS_OF_YOUR_EC2_SERVER

1. **Once logged in, run the Docker container** in interactive mode. This  command will start the Docker container, and bind the container’s port 8100 to the host EC2 instance’s port 80:

		docker run --rm -it -p 80:8100 awsdevops/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app

	> Troubleshooting: If you encounter a error saying “Bind for 0.0.0.0:80 failed: port is already allocated”, try: `sudo service docker restart`

1. **Configure the AWS credentials** to be used while inside the Docker container. Use the AWS credentials (AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Access Key ID) associated with the highly-privileged IAM user that was referenced in step #1.

		aws configure

	> Just accept the defaults when it asks for region and output format. The app configuration file at `~/api/config.js` configures the resources to be provisioned in `us-east-1` by default. Also, AWS credentials are NOT persisted across Docker container runs, so if you exit and later re-run the Docker container, remember to run `aws configure` again.

1. **Deploy the AWS resources into your account**

		cd /home/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app/api
		gulp deploy
		gulp bootstrap

1. **Start the Ionic 2 server.** This starts up the Ionic 2 server listening on port 8100, which is port-mapped (via Docker) to port 80 of the host EC2 instance.

		cd /home/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app/app
		ionic serve

1. **View the hybrid mobile app in your browser**, by visiting:

		http://PUBLIC_DNS_OF_YOUR_EC2_SERVER/

1. **Open the JavaScript console**. As you interact with the hybrid mobile app, useful info will appear in the JavaScript console.

	* For example, for Firefox on Mac, the JavaScript console can be toggled via the menu: `Tools > Web Developer > Web Console`. For Chrome on Mac: `View > Developer > JavaScript Console`.
	* It's helpful to have the JavaScript console docked on the right side of the browser main window. This will allow you to see the mobile app and JavaScript console output at the same time.

1. **Resize the browser main window**, to simulate the width of a mobile phone. Please be sure that you can see output displayed in the JavaScript console, as you click around the app.

# INTERACT AND LEARN (30 minutes)

Interact with the mobile app, and gain insights by viewing the behind-the-scenes info in the browser's JavaScript console. Explore how the AWS resources are configured.

---

### A. Register and Sign-in

1. **Register as a new user in the hybrid mobile app, using your e-mail address.**
  - *Note: Your email address is not tracked or stored or used for any purposes beyond your use in this lab, and is stored in the Cognito User Pool in your AWS account. The Cognito User Pool and other auto-generated AWS resources are un-deployed at the end of this lab.*
1. **Provide confirmation code from e-mail to validate e-mail and confirm registration**
1. **Sign-in as your new user**
	- Review the output in the browser's JavaScript console.
      - *Which JWT tokens are returned from Cognito User Pools?*
      - *Which AWS credential components are returned from Cognito Federated Identities?*
1. **Copy/paste the identity token into the JWT debugger at <http://jwt.io>, and decode it to see the base64-decoded content.**
	- *How long is the identity token valid for before it expires?*
    - *Which attributes are encoded in the token?*
1. **Copy/paste the access token into the JWT debugger at <http://jwt.io>, and decode it to see the base64-decoded content.**
	- *How long is the access token valid for before it expires?*
  - *Which attributes are encoded in the token?*
  - *Which attributes also exist in the identity token? Which ones are different?*

---

### B. API Gateway authorization using User Pools Authorizer

1. **Browse to "Resources" tab in the mobile app**
1. **Attempt to load locations "without Auth"**
    - *Based on the JavaScript console output, what was the URL path of the API request that was issued?*
    - *For this User Pools Authorizer request, which HTTP headers were sent?*
	- *What HTTP status code is returned?*
	- *Bonus question: Which HTTP headers are in the HTTP response? (Hint: Look at the Developer Tool's Network tab)*
1. **Attempt to load locations "with Auth"**
    - *What was the URL path of the API request that was issued?*
    - *For this User Pools Authorizer request, which HTTP headers were sent as part of the HTTP request?*

---
### C. API Gateway authorization using IAM Authorization
1.	**Click on a location**
	- *For this IAM Authorization request, which HTTP headers were sent?*
	- *How are the HTTP headers sent for IAM Authorization requests different than those sent for User Pool Authorizer requests?*
	- *Note that for IAM Authorization requests, a signature ("SigV4 signature") is calculated and sent as HTTP request headers. Note that User Pool Authorizer requests do not make use of any signatures.*
1.	**Select a resource (desk or conference room). Book one of the available timeslots.**
	- *Which HTTP method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) was called?*
	- *For this IAM Authorization request, which HTTP headers were sent?*
	- *Note that with IAM Authorization signing (aka "SigV4 signing"), the request URI, request body, and HTTP method are all used to calculate the signature.*
1. **Browse to "Bookings" tab, and cancel the booking you just made.**
	- *Which HTTP method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) was called?*

---

### D. S3 authorization using IAM Authorization

1. **Browse to "Account" tab.**
1. **Select to upload an local image as your profile picture. Any image will do.**
    - *This image will be stored directly in the S3 bucket that was created in your AWS account as part of the setup process. The image is uploaded directly to S3 using the AWS JavaScript S3 SDK (that is, it didn't go through API Gateway). The authorization headers are the same headers as those used earlier by API Gateway when configured to use IAM Authorization. This is because both API Gateway's IAM Authorization and the AWS SDKs rely on the same standard "SigV4 signing" method.*
	- *Temporary AWS credentials were used to sign the PUT request to the S3 API. How were these temporary AWS credentials obtained?*

---

### E. Fine-grained access control using IAM Authorization

1.	**You are currently logged in without Admin privileges. Toggle on "View Admin features", available in the "Account" tab"**. Note that you are NOT signed in currently as an administrator, so even though you can enable the display of Admin-only features, note that due to API authorization settings, the Admin-only API calls will still not work.
1.	**Browse back to "Resources" tab**
1.	**Click on "Add a location"**
1.	**Fill out the form and click on the “Add location” button**
	- *As expected, your API request is rejected because you don't have permissions to perform this API backend operation (because your account is not in the administrators group).*
	- *Bonus question: The HTTP response body will explain why your API request was denied. What is the HTTP response body? (Hint: Look at the Developer Tool's Network tab)*

---

### F. Fine-grained access control using Custom Authorizers

1. **Click on the arrow located in the upper left of the app (next to the `Add a Location` title), to return to the previous screen.**
1. **Click on "Load locations with Auth", and click on a location of your choice.**
1. **When viewing the resources for the location, click the "Delete" button next to one of the conference rooms/desks. Click "OK" to confirm when the confirmation dialog pops up.**
    - *An API Gateway Custom Authorizer is associated with this API operation. The Custom Authorizer logic evaluates the user's identity token and corresponding Cognito User Pools group memebership. Since your user isn't in the administrators group, the Custom Authorizer returns an IAM policy that effectively denies the user from performing this API operation.*

---
    
### G. Testing User Pool Authorizers using the API Gateway console

1.	**In a new browser tab/window, sign in to the AWS Management Console. Navigate to the API Gateway console.**
1.	**Click to view details for the "Spacefinder-API"**
2.	**In the lefthand menu, click "Authorizers" to view the Authorizers associated with 'Spacerfinder-API'**
3.  **View the details of the "spacefinder-userPool-authorizer"**
4.  **Copy your user's identity token from the JavaScript console in the other browser tab/window. (You may need to scroll back to the beginning of your JavaScript console to find the identity token.)**
5.  **Return back to the "spacefinder-userPool-authorizer" detail screen. In the righthand pane, scroll down to the "Test your authorizer" section. Paste the identity token into the "Identity token" textfield, and click "Test".**
    - *Assuming you pasted a valid token, you should see your decoded identity token in the "Claims" textbox. This signifies that you would pass this yes/no authorization check.*
6. **Make some minor edit to the value of the "Identity token" textfield, and click "Test" again.**
    - *You should now see an "Unauthorized request" message, which indicates that if this invalid token were to be sent to this API operation, it would result in a denied request.*
    
---

### H. Testing Custom Authorizers using the API Gateway console
    
1.  **While still on the "Authorizers" screen, click on 'spacefinder-custom-authorizer' to view details.**
1.  **In the righthand pane, scroll down to the "Test your authorizer" section. Paste the identity token into the "Identity token" textfield, and click "Test"**
    - *You should see an IAM Policy with permissions to Allow restricted access to the API operations. The IAM Policy also has explicit Deny statements to block the creation or deletion of locations/resources.*

---

### I. Logging in as an Admin

1. **Sign out, and sign back in as an Admin. Administrators can create and delete locations/resources. Sign-in as username `admin1` and default password `Test123!`**
1. **Copy the identity token displayed in the JavaScript console. Be sure to get the most recently displayed identity token.**
1. **Browse to "Resources" tab.**
1. **Click on "Load locations with Auth", and click on a location of your choice.**
1. **When viewing the resources for the location, click on the "Delete" button next to a conference room/desk. Click 'OK' to confirm when the dialog pops up.**
    - *An API Gateway Custom Authorizer is associated with this API operation. The Custom Authorizer logic evaluates the user's identity token and corresponding Cognito User Pools group membership. Since your user is in the administrators group, the Custom Authorizer returns an IAM policy that effectively allows the user to perform this API operation.*
1. **Click on the arrow located in the upper left of the app (next to the `Resources` title), to return to the previous screen.**
1. **Click on "Add a location"**
1.	**Fill out the form and click on the “Add location” button. You may use the default image URL for a default location image.**
	- *This time, your API request is successful, since your account is part of the administrators group, which is associated with an IAM role that has permissions to perform this API operation.*
1. **Click on "Load locations with Auth". You new location with an image should appear in the locations list.**

---

### J. Testing Authorizers using the API Gateway console, part 2

1.	**Return to the browser tab/window showing the API Gateway console.**
1.  **Navigate to the 'spacefinder-userPool-authorizer' detail screen. In the righthand pane, scroll down to the "Test your authorizer" section. Paste in the admin user's identity token into the "Identity token" textfield, and click "Test".**
    - *Assuming you pasted a valid token, you should see your decoded identity token in the "Claims" textbox. This signifies that you would pass this yes/no authorization check.*
1.  **While still on the "Authorizers" screen, click on 'spacefinder-custom-authorizer' to view the details for that authorizer.**
1.  **In the righthand pane, scroll down to the "Test your authorizer" section. Paste in the admin user's identity token into the "Identity token" textfield, and click "Test".**
    - *You should see an IAM Policy with permissions to Allow access to the API operations. Notice that the explicity Deny statements (when we tested earlier using the identity token associated with a non-Admin) are no longer present in the IAM Policy.*

---

### K. Exploring custom authorizer implementation details

1.	**Browse to the AWS Lambda console**
1.	**Click "Create a Lambda function"**
1.	**Enter "authorizer" in the filter search box**
1.	**Choose the custom authorizer Lambda blueprint for either Node.js or Python**
1.	**Do not add any triggers and click next**
1.	**Scroll down to the in-line text editor to see the Lambda blueprint sample code.**
1.	**Browse to <https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app/blob/master/api/lambda/authorizer.js>**
	- *This is the source code of the custom authorizer used for this project.*
	- *Which validations are performed against the HTTP request's authorization header passed to Lambda as part of the event object?*
	- *Since a custom authorizer should always return an effective IAM policy for a token sent to it, the project returns a “deny-all” policy for any invalid or malformed tokens.*
	
---

### L. Exploring the Cognito User Pools console

1.	**Browse to the Cognito User Pools console**
1.	**Select the "spacefinder-api-..." user pool**
1.	**Select "Users and Groups" from the left-hand panel**
1.	**Review your users in the right-hand panel**
1.	**Click on the "Groups" tab in the right-hand panel**
    - The precedence value indicates which group’s role should be chosen for a user if a user is a member of multiple groups
1.	**Click on the "adminGroup" to review the group details for standard users**
    - *Which IAM role is assigned to this group?*
    - *Can the IAM role and precedence settings be edited?*
1.	**Click on the "Groups" breadcrumb in the right-hand panel to go back**
1.	**Click on the "clientGroup" to review its settings**
    - *Is a different IAM role assigned to this group than the "adminGroup?"*
1.	**Click on Attributes in the left-hand panel**
    - *Are there any required attributes for new users in this user group?*
    - *Are there any custom attributes for users in this user group?*
1.	**Explore the Verifications section**
    - *This section governs requirements for new sign-ups and ongoing user sign-ins.*
    - *Notice the requirement of e-mail verification, hence the earlier confirmation code message.*
1.	**Evaluate the "apps" section**
    - *We only have one app for this project in this case since users only interact via the Ionic 2 mobile/web app.*
    - *"No Admin SRP" is required for the backend "gulp deploy" process (which you ran during setup) to be able to programatically login as our sample users to configure them and set their permanent passwords.*
    - *For production use, SRP is a best practice and "no admin SRP" auth should only be used for system logins with the user pool such as for user import/migration or for test automation purposes. In such cases, having a separate app for each backend system with this property set is advisable so client apps are required to use SRP in all cases.*
    - *A client secret is not needed for a JavaScript application, but can optionally be required for apps in other languages.*
    - *Additionally, different apps can have access to different attributes of the user pool where the identity token returned from Cognito User Pools for that app will only include attributes the given app has "read access" to.*

---

### M. Exploring the Cognito Federated Identities console

1.	**Browse to "Cognito Federated Identities" console**
1.	**Select the "Spacefinder" identity pool**
1.	**Click "Edit Identity Pool" in the top right**
1.	**Scroll down and expand the authentication providers section**
    - *Only the particular Cognito User Pool with its respective client ID is granted access to be able to assume an identity in this Cognito Federated identity pool*
    - *Since this app implements Cognito's fine-grained access control, beyond the default unauthenticated and authenticated roles associated for the identity pool, it is set to allow selection of the effective IAM role from a "token"*
    - *The token in this case is the "Cognito:preferred_role" attribute as shown in the decoded identity token returned from the user pool after sign-in.**

---

### N. Exploring the effective IAM policies

1.	**Browse to "CloudFormation" and select "spacefinder-api-..." stack**
1.	**Under "Outputs", scan for the "CognitoIdentityPoolAuthStandardRole"**
1.	**Copy the exact IAM role name for the standard role next to the output name**
1.	**Browse to the "IAM" console**
1.	**Click "Roles"**
1.	**Paste the copied value into the filter box**
    - *If the next screen showing the role details doesn’t automatically load, highlight the desired IAM role by clicking on it.*
1.	**Scroll down and click “Edit Policy” for the in-line policy on the role**
1.	**You should now see the effective IAM permissions for this policy**
    - *IAM policy variables specific to Cognito are leveraged to ensure a user can only create or delete resource bookings for him or herself, and not using other user’s IDs in the URI path.*
    - *Additionally, uploading of profile pictures to S3 is allowed, but only to the user’s particular path of their unique user ID within the S3 bucket.*
    - *If you were to look up the effective in-line IAM policy for the administrators role, you would see that these restrictions do not exist for administrators.*

---

### O. Exploring the client-side code to interact with Cognito

1. **Client-side interactions with Cognito make use of the Cognito JavaScript SDKs. Explore how the app interacts with Cognito, by taking a look at this class:
<https://github.com/awslabs/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app/blob/master/app/src/services/account-management.service.ts>**
    - *Which calls are using Cognito User Pools vs Cognito Federated Identities?*
    - *What types of API calls are needed to get AWS credentials?*
    - *When we sign out a user, how do we ensure that Cognito fully signs-out the user?*

---

# CLEANUP (1 minute)

Cleanup is fast and easy. This lab is self-contained and cleans up after itself by un-deploying all auto-generated AWS resources).

1. **Exit Ionic 2 console and stop the Ionic server.**
	- `Control-C` or `q` (for quit) will exit the Ionic 2 console.
  
> Troubleshooting: If your SSH session was terminated by the time you get to this point, don't worry about this Ionic 2 server step. However, you will need to repeat steps #3 through step #5 in the SETUP instructions, before you continue with the following steps. You will need to SSH back into your EC2 instance, start up the Docker container, and configure your AWS credentials, before continuing with the rest of the CLEANUP steps.

1. **Un-deploy all AWS resources**:

		cd /home/aws-serverless-auth-reference-app/api
	 	gulp undeploy

1. **Exit the Docker container**

	- Type `exit` at the command line.

1. **Terminate the EC2 instance.**
